### Name (working): **LifeLog OS**

- **What it is**  
  A privacy-respecting, AI-powered “personal memory operating system.”  
  Every note, photo, voice clip, e-mail thread or calendar event flows into one place, is auto-tagged and linked, and can be shared with only the people who lived that moment with you.

- **Problem it solves**

  > _“My memories are scattered across Google Photos, Instagram, WhatsApp chats, and half-written journal apps. I can’t find the story of my life when I need it, and sharing a specific slice is painful.”_

- **Target user (v1)**

  - 30-somethings who enjoy documenting life (or want to start)
  - New parents, foodie Instagrammers, quantified-self geeks
  - Comfortably pay for premium software; care about ownership & privacy

- **Core value props**

  1. **Zero-friction capture** – Superhuman-style command bar; paste or dictate and keep writing.
  2. **AI enrichment** – Automatic tagging, face/people detection, semantic search, weekly digests.
  3. **Memory graph** – Timeline meets graph: hop from “Japan 2022” → “ramen photos” → “who was there.”
  4. **Selective sharing** – One click to let your partner co-edit the Paris trip memories; influencers can publish publicly.
  5. **Ownership & exit** – End-to-end encrypted storage (server-side for v0), one-click export/delete.

- **10-second demo line**
  > “Like Superhuman for journaling + Notion’s flexibility, with an AI brain that remembers everything for you.”
